# Z shell (zsh) dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles for `zsh` that I use on my local development machines. I have switched moved away from oh-my-zsh and prezto mainly because I felt it was overly bloated for what I used it for.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:ldejager/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
